## Introduction

When using any tool in the "real world", you feel more confident if you understand how that tool works. Application development is no different. When you understand how your development tools function, you feel more comfortable and confident using them.

The goal of this document is to give you a good, high-level overview of how the Laravel framework works. By getting to know the overall framework better, everything feels less "magical" and you will be more confident building your applications. If you don't understand all of the terms right away, don't lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what is going on, and your knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation.

## Lifecycle Overview

<a name="first-steps"></a>
### First Steps

The entry point for all requests to a Laravel application is the `public/index.php` file. All requests are directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. The `index.php` file doesn't contain much code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework.

The `index.php` file loads the Composer generated autoloader definition, and then retrieves an instance of the Laravel application from `bootstrap/app.php`. The first action taken by Laravel itself is to create an instance of the application / [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container).

<a name="http-console-kernels"></a>
### HTTP / Console Kernels

Next, the incoming request is sent to either the HTTP kernel or the console kernel, using the `handleRequest` or `handleCommand` methods of the application instance, depending on the type of request entering the application. These two kernels serve as the central location through which all requests flow. For now, let's just focus on the HTTP kernel, which is an instance of `Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel`.

The HTTP kernel defines an array of `bootstrappers` that will be run before the request is executed. These bootstrappers configure error handling, configure logging, [detect the application environment](/docs/{{version}}/configuration#environment-configuration), and perform other tasks that need to be done before the request is actually handled. Typically, these classes handle internal Laravel configuration that you do not need to worry about.

The HTTP kernel is also responsible for passing the request through the application's middleware stack. These middleware handle reading and writing the [HTTP session](/docs/{{version}}/session), determining if the application is in maintenance mode, [verifying the CSRF token](/docs/{{version}}/csrf), and more. We'll talk more about these soon.

The method signature for the HTTP kernel's `handle` method is quite simple: it receives a `Request` and returns a `Response`. Think of the kernel as being a big black box that represents your entire application. Feed it HTTP requests and it will return HTTP responses.

<a name="service-providers"></a>
### Service Providers

One of the most important kernel bootstrapping actions is loading the [service providers](/docs/{{version}}/providers) for your application. Service providers are responsible for bootstrapping all of the framework's various components, such as the database, queue, validation, and routing components.

Laravel will iterate through this list of providers and instantiate each of them. After instantiating the providers, the `register` method will be called on all of the providers. Then, once all of the providers have been registered, the `boot` method will be called on each provider. This is so service providers may depend on every container binding being registered and available by the time their `boot` method is executed.

Essentially every major feature offered by Laravel is bootstrapped and configured by a service provider. Since they bootstrap and configure so many features offered by the framework, service providers are the most important aspect of the entire Laravel bootstrap process.

While the framework internally uses dozens of service providers, you also have the option to create your own. You can find a list of the user-defined or third-party service providers that your application is using in the `bootstrap/providers.php` file.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="routing"></a>
### Routing

Once the application has been bootstrapped and all service providers have been registered, the `Request` will be handed off to the router for dispatching. The router will dispatch the request to a route or controller, as well as run any route specific middleware.

Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering or examining HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies if the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to the login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application. Some middleware are assigned to all routes within the application, like `PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance`, while some are only assigned to specific routes or route groups. You can learn more about middleware by reading the complete [middleware documentation](/docs/{{version}}/middleware).

If the request passes through all of the matched route's assigned middleware, the route or controller method will be executed and the response returned by the route or controller method will be sent back through the route's chain of middleware.

<a name="finishing-up"></a>
### Finishing Up

Once the route or controller method returns a response, the response will travel back outward through the route's middleware, giving the application a chance to modify or examine the outgoing response.

Finally, once the response travels back through the middleware, the HTTP kernel's `handle` method returns the response object to the `handleRequest` of the application instance, and this method calls the `send` method on the returned response. The `send` method sends the response content to the user's web browser. We've now completed our journey through the entire Laravel request lifecycle!

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="focus-on-service-providers"></a>
## Focus on Service Providers

Service providers are truly the key to bootstrapping a Laravel application. The application instance is created, the service providers are registered, and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application. It's really that simple!

Having a firm grasp of how a Laravel application is built and bootstrapped via service providers is very valuable. Your application's user-defined service providers are stored in the `app/Providers` directory.

By default, the `AppServiceProvider` is fairly empty. This provider is a great place to add your application's own bootstrapping and service container bindings. For large applications, you may wish to create several service providers, each with more granular bootstrapping for specific services used by your application.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that essentially means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.

Let's look at a simple example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Services\AppleMusic;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class PodcastController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        protected AppleMusic $apple,
    ) {}

    /**
     * Show information about the given podcast.
     */
    public function show(string $id): View
    {
        return view('podcasts.show', [
            'podcast' => $this->apple->findPodcast($id)
        ]);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `PodcastController` needs to retrieve podcasts from a data source such as Apple Music. So, we will **inject** a service that is able to retrieve podcasts. Since the service is injected, we are able to easily "mock", or create a dummy implementation of the `AppleMusic` service when testing our application.

A deep understanding of the Laravel service container is essential to building a powerful, large application, as well as for contributing to the Laravel core itself.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="zero-configuration-resolution"></a>
### Zero Configuration Resolution

If a class has no dependencies or only depends on other concrete classes (not interfaces), the container does not need to be instructed on how to resolve that class. For example, you may place the following code in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php
class Service
{
    // ...
}

Route::get('/', function (Service $service) {
    die($service::class);
});
```

In this example, hitting your application's `/` route will automatically resolve the `Service` class and inject it into your route's handler. This is game changing. It means you can develop your application and take advantage of dependency injection without worrying about bloated configuration files.

Thankfully, many of the classes you will be writing when building a Laravel application automatically receive their dependencies via the container, including [controllers](/docs/{{version}}/controllers), [event listeners](/docs/{{version}}/events), [middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware), and more. Additionally, you may type-hint dependencies in the `handle` method of [queued jobs](/docs/{{version}}/queues). Once you taste the power of automatic and zero configuration dependency injection it feels impossible to develop without it.

<a name="when-to-use-the-container"></a>
### When to Utilize the Container

Thanks to zero configuration resolution, you will often type-hint dependencies on routes, controllers, event listeners, and elsewhere without ever manually interacting with the container. For example, you might type-hint the `Illuminate\Http\Request` object on your route definition so that you can easily access the current request. Even though we never have to interact with the container to write this code, it is managing the injection of these dependencies behind the scenes:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/', function (Request $request) {
    // ...
});
```

In many cases, thanks to automatic dependency injection and [facades](/docs/{{version}}/facades), you can build Laravel applications without **ever** manually binding or resolving anything from the container. **So, when would you ever manually interact with the container?** Let's examine two situations.

First, if you write a class that implements an interface and you wish to type-hint that interface on a route or class constructor, you must [tell the container how to resolve that interface](#binding-interfaces-to-implementations). Secondly, if you are [writing a Laravel package](/docs/{{version}}/packages) that you plan to share with other Laravel developers, you may need to bind your package's services into the container.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="binding"></a>
## Binding

<a name="binding-basics"></a>
### Binding Basics

<a name="simple-bindings"></a>
#### Simple Bindings

Almost all of your service container bindings will be registered within [service providers](/docs/{{version}}/providers), so most of these examples will demonstrate using the container in that context.

Within a service provider, you always have access to the container via the `$this->app` property. We can register a binding using the `bind` method, passing the class or interface name that we wish to register along with a closure that returns an instance of the class:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use App\Services\PodcastParser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;

$this->app->bind(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

Note that we receive the container itself as an argument to the resolver. We can then use the container to resolve sub-dependencies of the object we are building.

As mentioned, you will typically be interacting with the container within service providers; however, if you would like to interact with the container outside of a service provider, you may do so via the `App` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades):

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

App::bind(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    // ...
});
```

You may use the `bindIf` method to register a container binding only if a binding has not already been registered for the given type:

```php
$this->app->bindIf(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

For convenience, you may omit providing the class or interface name that you wish to register as a separate argument and instead allow Laravel to infer the type from the return type of the closure you provide to the `bind` method:

```php
App::bind(function (Application $app): Transistor {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is no need to bind classes into the container if they do not depend on any interfaces. The container does not need to be instructed on how to build these objects, since it can automatically resolve these objects using reflection.

<a name="binding-a-singleton"></a>
#### Binding A Singleton

The `singleton` method binds a class or interface into the container that should only be resolved one time. Once a singleton binding is resolved, the same object instance will be returned on subsequent calls into the container:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use App\Services\PodcastParser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;

$this->app->singleton(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

You may use the `singletonIf` method to register a singleton container binding only if a binding has not already been registered for the given type:

```php
$this->app->singletonIf(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="binding-scoped"></a>
#### Binding Scoped Singletons

The `scoped` method binds a class or interface into the container that should only be resolved one time within a given Laravel request / job lifecycle. While this method is similar to the `singleton` method, instances registered using the `scoped` method will be flushed whenever the Laravel application starts a new "lifecycle", such as when a [Laravel Octane](/docs/{{version}}/octane) worker processes a new request or when a Laravel [queue worker](/docs/{{version}}/queues) processes a new job:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use App\Services\PodcastParser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;

$this->app->scoped(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

You may use the `scopedIf` method to register a scoped container binding only if a binding has not already been registered for the given type:

```php
$this->app->scopedIf(Transistor::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
});
```

<a name="binding-instances"></a>
#### Binding Instances

You may also bind an existing object instance into the container using the `instance` method. The given instance will always be returned on subsequent calls into the container:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use App\Services\PodcastParser;

$service = new Transistor(new PodcastParser);

$this->app->instance(Transistor::class, $service);
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="binding-interfaces-to-implementations"></a>
### Binding Interfaces to Implementations

A very powerful feature of the service container is its ability to bind an interface to a given implementation. For example, let's assume we have an `EventPusher` interface and a `RedisEventPusher` implementation. Once we have coded our `RedisEventPusher` implementation of this interface, we can register it with the service container like so:

```php
use App\Contracts\EventPusher;
use App\Services\RedisEventPusher;

$this->app->bind(EventPusher::class, RedisEventPusher::class);
```

This statement tells the container that it should inject the `RedisEventPusher` when a class needs an implementation of `EventPusher`. Now we can type-hint the `EventPusher` interface in the constructor of a class that is resolved by the container. Remember, controllers, event listeners, middleware, and various other types of classes within Laravel applications are always resolved using the container:

```php
use App\Contracts\EventPusher;

/**
 * Create a new class instance.
 */
public function __construct(
    protected EventPusher $pusher,
) {}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="contextual-binding"></a>
### Contextual Binding

Sometimes you may have two classes that utilize the same interface, but you wish to inject different implementations into each class. For example, two controllers may depend on different implementations of the `Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem` [contract](/docs/{{version}}/contracts). Laravel provides a simple, fluent interface for defining this behavior:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PhotoController;
use App\Http\Controllers\UploadController;
use App\Http\Controllers\VideoController;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

$this->app->when(PhotoController::class)
    ->needs(Filesystem::class)
    ->give(function () {
        return Storage::disk('local');
    });

$this->app->when([VideoController::class, UploadController::class])
    ->needs(Filesystem::class)
    ->give(function () {
        return Storage::disk('s3');
    });
```

<a name="contextual-attributes"></a>
### Contextual Attributes

Since contextual binding is often used to inject implementations of drivers or configuration values, Laravel offers a variety of contextual binding attributes that allow to inject these types of values without manually defining the contextual bindings in your service providers.

For example, the `Storage` attribute may be used to inject a specific [storage disk](/docs/{{version}}/filesystem):

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Storage;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem;

class PhotoController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Storage('local')] protected Filesystem $filesystem
    )
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

In addition to the `Storage` attribute, Laravel offers `Auth`, `Cache`, `Config`, `DB`, `Log`, `RouteParameter`, and [`Tag`](#tagging) attributes:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Photo;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Auth;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Cache;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Config;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\DB;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Log;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\RouteParameter;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\Tag;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Guard;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository;
use Illuminate\Database\Connection;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

class PhotoController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Auth('web')] protected Guard $auth,
        #[Cache('redis')] protected Repository $cache,
        #[Config('app.timezone')] protected string $timezone,
        #[DB('mysql')] protected Connection $connection,
        #[Log('daily')] protected LoggerInterface $log,
        #[RouteParameter('photo')] protected Photo $photo,
        #[Tag('reports')] protected iterable $reports,
    )
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Furthermore, Laravel provides a `CurrentUser` attribute for injecting the currently authenticated user into a given route or class:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Container\Attributes\CurrentUser;

Route::get('/user', function (#[CurrentUser] User $user) {
    return $user;
})->middleware('auth');
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="defining-custom-attributes"></a>
#### Defining Custom Attributes

You can create your own contextual attributes by implementing the `Illuminate\Contracts\Container\ContextualAttribute` contract. The container will call your attribute's `resolve` method, which should resolve the value that should be injected into the class utilizing the attribute. In the example below, we will re-implement Laravel's built-in `Config` attribute:

```php
namespace App\Attributes;

use Attribute;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\ContextualAttribute;

#[Attribute(Attribute::TARGET_PARAMETER)]
class Config implements ContextualAttribute
{
    /**
     * Create a new attribute instance.
     */
    public function __construct(public string $key, public mixed $default = null)
    {
    }

    /**
     * Resolve the configuration value.
     *
     * @param  self  $attribute
     * @param  \Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container  $container
     * @return mixed
     */
    public static function resolve(self $attribute, Container $container)
    {
        return $container->make('config')->get($attribute->key, $attribute->default);
    }
}
```

<a name="binding-primitives"></a>
### Binding Primitives

Sometimes you may have a class that receives some injected classes, but also needs an injected primitive value such as an integer. You may easily use contextual binding to inject any value your class may need:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

$this->app->when(UserController::class)
    ->needs('$variableName')
    ->give($value);
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Sometimes a class may depend on an array of [tagged](#tagging) instances. Using the `giveTagged` method, you may easily inject all of the container bindings with that tag:

```php
$this->app->when(ReportAggregator::class)
    ->needs('$reports')
    ->giveTagged('reports');
```

If you need to inject a value from one of your application's configuration files, you may use the `giveConfig` method:

```php
$this->app->when(ReportAggregator::class)
    ->needs('$timezone')
    ->giveConfig('app.timezone');
```

<a name="binding-typed-variadics"></a>
### Binding Typed Variadics

Occasionally, you may have a class that receives an array of typed objects using a variadic constructor argument:

```php
<?php

use App\Models\Filter;
use App\Services\Logger;

class Firewall
{
    /**
     * The filter instances.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $filters;

    /**
     * Create a new class instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        protected Logger $logger,
        Filter ...$filters,
    ) {
        $this->filters = $filters;
    }
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Using contextual binding, you may resolve this dependency by providing the `give` method with a closure that returns an array of resolved `Filter` instances:

```php
$this->app->when(Firewall::class)
    ->needs(Filter::class)
    ->give(function (Application $app) {
          return [
              $app->make(NullFilter::class),
              $app->make(ProfanityFilter::class),
              $app->make(TooLongFilter::class),
          ];
    });
```

For convenience, you may also just provide an array of class names to be resolved by the container whenever `Firewall` needs `Filter` instances:

```php
$this->app->when(Firewall::class)
    ->needs(Filter::class)
    ->give([
        NullFilter::class,
        ProfanityFilter::class,
        TooLongFilter::class,
    ]);
```

<a name="variadic-tag-dependencies"></a>
#### Variadic Tag Dependencies

Sometimes a class may have a variadic dependency that is type-hinted as a given class (`Report ...$reports`). Using the `needs` and `giveTagged` methods, you may easily inject all of the container bindings with that [tag](#tagging) for the given dependency:

```php
$this->app->when(ReportAggregator::class)
    ->needs(Report::class)
    ->giveTagged('reports');
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="tagging"></a>
### Tagging

Occasionally, you may need to resolve all of a certain "category" of binding. For example, perhaps you are building a report analyzer that receives an array of many different `Report` interface implementations. After registering the `Report` implementations, you can assign them a tag using the `tag` method:

```php
$this->app->bind(CpuReport::class, function () {
    // ...
});

$this->app->bind(MemoryReport::class, function () {
    // ...
});

$this->app->tag([CpuReport::class, MemoryReport::class], 'reports');
```

Once the services have been tagged, you may easily resolve them all via the container's `tagged` method:

```php
$this->app->bind(ReportAnalyzer::class, function (Application $app) {
    return new ReportAnalyzer($app->tagged('reports'));
});
```

<a name="extending-bindings"></a>
### Extending Bindings

The `extend` method allows the modification of resolved services. For example, when a service is resolved, you may run additional code to decorate or configure the service. The `extend` method accepts two arguments, the service class you're extending and a closure that should return the modified service. The closure receives the service being resolved and the container instance:

```php
$this->app->extend(Service::class, function (Service $service, Application $app) {
    return new DecoratedService($service);
});
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="resolving"></a>
## Resolving

<a name="the-make-method"></a>
### The `make` Method

You may use the `make` method to resolve a class instance from the container. The `make` method accepts the name of the class or interface you wish to resolve:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;

$transistor = $this->app->make(Transistor::class);
```

If some of your class's dependencies are not resolvable via the container, you may inject them by passing them as an associative array into the `makeWith` method. For example, we may manually pass the `$id` constructor argument required by the `Transistor` service:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;

$transistor = $this->app->makeWith(Transistor::class, ['id' => 1]);
```

The `bound` method may be used to determine if a class or interface has been explicitly bound in the container:

```php
if ($this->app->bound(Transistor::class)) {
    // ...
}
```

If you are outside of a service provider in a location of your code that does not have access to the `$app` variable, you may use the `App` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades) or the `app` [helper](/docs/{{version}}/helpers#method-app) to resolve a class instance from the container:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

$transistor = App::make(Transistor::class);

$transistor = app(Transistor::class);
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

If you would like to have the Laravel container instance itself injected into a class that is being resolved by the container, you may type-hint the `Illuminate\Container\Container` class on your class's constructor:

```php
use Illuminate\Container\Container;

/**
 * Create a new class instance.
 */
public function __construct(
    protected Container $container,
) {}
```

<a name="automatic-injection"></a>
### Automatic Injection

Alternatively, and importantly, you may type-hint the dependency in the constructor of a class that is resolved by the container, including [controllers](/docs/{{version}}/controllers), [event listeners](/docs/{{version}}/events), [middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware), and more. Additionally, you may type-hint dependencies in the `handle` method of [queued jobs](/docs/{{version}}/queues). In practice, this is how most of your objects should be resolved by the container.

For example, you may type-hint a service defined by your application in a controller's constructor. The service will automatically be resolved and injected into the class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Services\AppleMusic;

class PodcastController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        protected AppleMusic $apple,
    ) {}

    /**
     * Show information about the given podcast.
     */
    public function show(string $id): Podcast
    {
        return $this->apple->findPodcast($id);
    }
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="method-invocation-and-injection"></a>
## Method Invocation and Injection

Sometimes you may wish to invoke a method on an object instance while allowing the container to automatically inject that method's dependencies. For example, given the following class:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use App\Services\AppleMusic;

class PodcastStats
{
    /**
     * Generate a new podcast stats report.
     */
    public function generate(AppleMusic $apple): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

You may invoke the `generate` method via the container like so:

```php
use App\PodcastStats;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

$stats = App::call([new PodcastStats, 'generate']);
```

The `call` method accepts any PHP callable. The container's `call` method may even be used to invoke a closure while automatically injecting its dependencies:

```php
use App\Services\AppleMusic;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

$result = App::call(function (AppleMusic $apple) {
    // ...
});
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="container-events"></a>
## Container Events

The service container fires an event each time it resolves an object. You may listen to this event using the `resolving` method:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;

$this->app->resolving(Transistor::class, function (Transistor $transistor, Application $app) {
    // Called when container resolves objects of type "Transistor"...
});

$this->app->resolving(function (mixed $object, Application $app) {
    // Called when container resolves object of any type...
});
```

As you can see, the object being resolved will be passed to the callback, allowing you to set any additional properties on the object before it is given to its consumer.

<a name="rebinding"></a>
### Rebinding

The `rebinding` method allows you to listen for when a service is re-bound to the container, meaning it is registered again or overridden after its initial binding. This can be useful when you need to update dependencies or modify behavior each time a specific binding is updated:

```php
use App\Contracts\PodcastPublisher;
use App\Services\SpotifyPublisher;
use App\Services\TransistorPublisher;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;

$this->app->bind(PodcastPublisher::class, SpotifyPublisher::class);

$this->app->rebinding(
    PodcastPublisher::class,
    function (Application $app, PodcastPublisher $newInstance) {
        //
    },
);

// New binding will trigger rebinding closure...
$this->app->bind(PodcastPublisher::class, TransistorPublisher::class);
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="psr-11"></a>
## PSR-11

Laravel's service container implements the [PSR-11](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-11-container.md) interface. Therefore, you may type-hint the PSR-11 container interface to obtain an instance of the Laravel container:

```php
use App\Services\Transistor;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

Route::get('/', function (ContainerInterface $container) {
    $service = $container->get(Transistor::class);

    // ...
});
```

An exception is thrown if the given identifier can't be resolved. The exception will be an instance of `Psr\Container\NotFoundExceptionInterface` if the identifier was never bound. If the identifier was bound but was unable to be resolved, an instance of `Psr\Container\ContainerExceptionInterface` will be thrown.

## Introduction

Service providers are the central place of all Laravel application bootstrapping. Your own application, as well as all of Laravel's core services, are bootstrapped via service providers.

But, what do we mean by "bootstrapped"? In general, we mean **registering** things, including registering service container bindings, event listeners, middleware, and even routes. Service providers are the central place to configure your application.

Laravel uses dozens of service providers internally to bootstrap its core services, such as the mailer, queue, cache, and others. Many of these providers are "deferred" providers, meaning they will not be loaded on every request, but only when the services they provide are actually needed.

All user-defined service providers are registered in the `bootstrap/providers.php` file. In the following documentation, you will learn how to write your own service providers and register them with your Laravel application.

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to learn more about how Laravel handles requests and works internally, check out our documentation on the Laravel [request lifecycle](/docs/{{version}}/lifecycle).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="writing-service-providers"></a>
## Writing Service Providers

All service providers extend the `Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider` class. Most service providers contain a `register` and a `boot` method. Within the `register` method, you should **only bind things into the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container)**. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the `register` method.

The Artisan CLI can generate a new provider via the `make:provider` command. Laravel will automatically register your new provider in your application's `bootstrap/providers.php` file:

```shell
php artisan make:provider RiakServiceProvider
```

<a name="the-register-method"></a>
### The Register Method

As mentioned previously, within the `register` method, you should only bind things into the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container). You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the `register` method. Otherwise, you may accidentally use a service that is provided by a service provider which has not loaded yet.

Let's take a look at a basic service provider. Within any of your service provider methods, you always have access to the `$app` property which provides access to the service container:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Services\Riak\Connection;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class RiakServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->singleton(Connection::class, function (Application $app) {
            return new Connection(config('riak'));
        });
    }
}
```

This service provider only defines a `register` method, and uses that method to define an implementation of `App\Services\Riak\Connection` in the service container. If you're not yet familiar with Laravel's service container, check out [its documentation](/docs/{{version}}/container).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="the-bindings-and-singletons-properties"></a>
#### The `bindings` and `singletons` Properties

If your service provider registers many simple bindings, you may wish to use the `bindings` and `singletons` properties instead of manually registering each container binding. When the service provider is loaded by the framework, it will automatically check for these properties and register their bindings:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Contracts\DowntimeNotifier;
use App\Contracts\ServerProvider;
use App\Services\DigitalOceanServerProvider;
use App\Services\PingdomDowntimeNotifier;
use App\Services\ServerToolsProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * All of the container bindings that should be registered.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    public $bindings = [
        ServerProvider::class => DigitalOceanServerProvider::class,
    ];

    /**
     * All of the container singletons that should be registered.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    public $singletons = [
        DowntimeNotifier::class => PingdomDowntimeNotifier::class,
        ServerProvider::class => ServerToolsProvider::class,
    ];
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="the-boot-method"></a>
### The Boot Method

So, what if we need to register a [view composer](/docs/{{version}}/views#view-composers) within our service provider? This should be done within the `boot` method. **This method is called after all other service providers have been registered**, meaning you have access to all other services that have been registered by the framework:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class ComposerServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        View::composer('view', function () {
            // ...
        });
    }
}
```

<a name="boot-method-dependency-injection"></a>
#### Boot Method Dependency Injection

You may type-hint dependencies for your service provider's `boot` method. The [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container) will automatically inject any dependencies you need:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\ResponseFactory;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(ResponseFactory $response): void
{
    $response->macro('serialized', function (mixed $value) {
        // ...
    });
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="registering-providers"></a>
## Registering Providers

All service providers are registered in the `bootstrap/providers.php` configuration file. This file returns an array that contains the class names of your application's service providers:

```php
<?php

return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
];
```

When you invoke the `make:provider` Artisan command, Laravel will automatically add the generated provider to the `bootstrap/providers.php` file. However, if you have manually created the provider class, you should manually add the provider class to the array:

```php
<?php

return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider::class, // [tl! add]
];
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="deferred-providers"></a>
## Deferred Providers

If your provider is **only** registering bindings in the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container), you may choose to defer its registration until one of the registered bindings is actually needed. Deferring the loading of such a provider will improve the performance of your application, since it is not loaded from the filesystem on every request.

Laravel compiles and stores a list of all of the services supplied by deferred service providers, along with the name of its service provider class. Then, only when you attempt to resolve one of these services does Laravel load the service provider.

To defer the loading of a provider, implement the `\Illuminate\Contracts\Support\DeferrableProvider` interface and define a `provides` method. The `provides` method should return the service container bindings registered by the provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Services\Riak\Connection;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\DeferrableProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class RiakServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider implements DeferrableProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->singleton(Connection::class, function (Application $app) {
            return new Connection($app['config']['riak']);
        });
    }

    /**
     * Get the services provided by the provider.
     *
     * @return array<int, string>
     */
    public function provides(): array
    {
        return [Connection::class];
    }
}
```

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Throughout the Laravel documentation, you will see examples of code that interacts with Laravel's features via "facades". Facades provide a "static" interface to classes that are available in the application's [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container). Laravel ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Laravel's features.

Laravel facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. It's perfectly fine if you don't totally understand how facades work - just go with the flow and continue learning about Laravel.

All of Laravel's facades are defined in the `Illuminate\Support\Facades` namespace. So, we can easily access a facade like so:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/cache', function () {
    return Cache::get('key');
});
```

Throughout the Laravel documentation, many of the examples will use facades to demonstrate various features of the framework.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="helper-functions"></a>
#### Helper Functions

To complement facades, Laravel offers a variety of global "helper functions" that make it even easier to interact with common Laravel features. Some of the common helper functions you may interact with are `view`, `response`, `url`, `config`, and more. Each helper function offered by Laravel is documented with their corresponding feature; however, a complete list is available within the dedicated [helper documentation](/docs/{{version}}/helpers).

For example, instead of using the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response` facade to generate a JSON response, we may simply use the `response` function. Because helper functions are globally available, you do not need to import any classes in order to use them:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response;

Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Response::json([
        // ...
    ]);
});

Route::get('/users', function () {
    return response()->json([
        // ...
    ]);
});
```

<a name="when-to-use-facades"></a>
## When to Utilize Facades

Facades have many benefits. They provide a terse, memorable syntax that allows you to use Laravel's features without remembering long class names that must be injected or configured manually. Furthermore, because of their unique usage of PHP's dynamic methods, they are easy to test.

However, some care must be taken when using facades. The primary danger of facades is class "scope creep". Since facades are so easy to use and do not require injection, it can be easy to let your classes continue to grow and use many facades in a single class. Using dependency injection, this potential is mitigated by the visual feedback a large constructor gives you that your class is growing too large. So, when using facades, pay special attention to the size of your class so that its scope of responsibility stays narrow. If your class is getting too large, consider splitting it into multiple smaller classes.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="facades-vs-dependency-injection"></a>
### Facades vs. Dependency Injection

One of the primary benefits of dependency injection is the ability to swap implementations of the injected class. This is useful during testing since you can inject a mock or stub and assert that various methods were called on the stub.

Typically, it would not be possible to mock or stub a truly static class method. However, since facades use dynamic methods to proxy method calls to objects resolved from the service container, we actually can test facades just as we would test an injected class instance. For example, given the following route:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

Route::get('/cache', function () {
    return Cache::get('key');
});
```

Using Laravel's facade testing methods, we can write the following test to verify that the `Cache::get` method was called with the argument we expected:

```php tab=Pest
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

test('basic example', function () {
    Cache::shouldReceive('get')
        ->with('key')
        ->andReturn('value');

    $response = $this->get('/cache');

    $response->assertSee('value');
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

/**
 * A basic functional test example.
 */
public function test_basic_example(): void
{
    Cache::shouldReceive('get')
        ->with('key')
        ->andReturn('value');

    $response = $this->get('/cache');

    $response->assertSee('value');
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="facades-vs-helper-functions"></a>
### Facades vs. Helper Functions

In addition to facades, Laravel includes a variety of "helper" functions which can perform common tasks like generating views, firing events, dispatching jobs, or sending HTTP responses. Many of these helper functions perform the same function as a corresponding facade. For example, this facade call and helper call are equivalent:

```php
return Illuminate\Support\Facades\View::make('profile');

return view('profile');
```

There is absolutely no practical difference between facades and helper functions. When using helper functions, you may still test them exactly as you would the corresponding facade. For example, given the following route:

```php
Route::get('/cache', function () {
    return cache('key');
});
```

The `cache` helper is going to call the `get` method on the class underlying the `Cache` facade. So, even though we are using the helper function, we can write the following test to verify that the method was called with the argument we expected:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

/**
 * A basic functional test example.
 */
public function test_basic_example(): void
{
    Cache::shouldReceive('get')
        ->with('key')
        ->andReturn('value');

    $response = $this->get('/cache');

    $response->assertSee('value');
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="how-facades-work"></a>
## How Facades Work

In a Laravel application, a facade is a class that provides access to an object from the container. The machinery that makes this work is in the `Facade` class. Laravel's facades, and any custom facades you create, will extend the base `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade` class.

The `Facade` base class makes use of the `__callStatic()` magic-method to defer calls from your facade to an object resolved from the container. In the example below, a call is made to the Laravel cache system. By glancing at this code, one might assume that the static `get` method is being called on the `Cache` class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Show the profile for the given user.
     */
    public function showProfile(string $id): View
    {
        $user = Cache::get('user:'.$id);

        return view('profile', ['user' => $user]);
    }
}
```

Notice that near the top of the file we are "importing" the `Cache` facade. This facade serves as a proxy for accessing the underlying implementation of the `Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Factory` interface. Any calls we make using the facade will be passed to the underlying instance of Laravel's cache service.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

If we look at that `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache` class, you'll see that there is no static method `get`:

```php
class Cache extends Facade
{
    /**
     * Get the registered name of the component.
     */
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor(): string
    {
        return 'cache';
    }
}
```

Instead, the `Cache` facade extends the base `Facade` class and defines the method `getFacadeAccessor()`. This method's job is to return the name of a service container binding. When a user references any static method on the `Cache` facade, Laravel resolves the `cache` binding from the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container) and runs the requested method (in this case, `get`) against that object.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<a name="real-time-facades"></a>
## Real-Time Facades

Using real-time facades, you may treat any class in your application as if it was a facade. To illustrate how this can be used, let's first examine some code that does not use real-time facades. For example, let's assume our `Podcast` model has a `publish` method. However, in order to publish the podcast, we need to inject a `Publisher` instance:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\Publisher;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Podcast extends Model
{
    /**
     * Publish the podcast.
     */
    public function publish(Publisher $publisher): void
    {
        $this->update(['publishing' => now()]);

        $publisher->publish($this);
    }
}
```

Injecting a publisher implementation into the method allows us to easily test the method in isolation since we can mock the injected publisher. However, it requires us to always pass a publisher instance each time we call the `publish` method. Using real-time facades, we can maintain the same testability while not being required to explicitly pass a `Publisher` instance. To generate a real-time facade, prefix the namespace of the imported class with `Facades`:

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\Publisher; // [tl! remove]
use Facades\App\Contracts\Publisher; // [tl! add]
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Podcast extends Model
{
    /**
     * Publish the podcast.
     */
    public function publish(Publisher $publisher): void // [tl! remove]
    public function publish(): void // [tl! add]
    {
        $this->update(['publishing' => now()]);

        $publisher->publish($this); // [tl! remove]
        Publisher::publish($this); // [tl! add]
    }
}
```

When the real-time facade is used, the publisher implementation will be resolved out of the service container using the portion of the interface or class name that appears after the `Facades` prefix. When testing, we can use Laravel's built-in facade testing helpers to mock this method call:

```php tab=Pest
<?php

use App\Models\Podcast;
use Facades\App\Contracts\Publisher;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

uses(RefreshDatabase::class);

test('podcast can be published', function () {
    $podcast = Podcast::factory()->create();

    Publisher::shouldReceive('publish')->once()->with($podcast);

    $podcast->publish();
});
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use App\Models\Podcast;
use Facades\App\Contracts\Publisher;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use Tests\TestCase;

class PodcastTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    /**
     * A test example.
     */
    public function test_podcast_can_be_published(): void
    {
        $podcast = Podcast::factory()->create();

        Publisher::shouldReceive('publish')->once()->with($podcast);

        $podcast->publish();
    }
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>
