This repository provides a **well-formatted, print-friendly PDF version** of the official Laravel documentation. The content remains **unchanged**, but thoughtful **page breaks** and layout improvements make it **easier to read and print**.  

🔔 **Stay Updated!**  
Watch this repository to get notified when new Laravel versions are released in a **printable PDF format**.
